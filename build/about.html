	<h3 style="text-align: center;">Aspiring Data Scentist</h3>

	<p> My name is Edward. I'm an aspiring [data scientist / data analyst] with a background in economic theory, data analysis and computing. I've reviewed the job description for the [job title] role and I believe that I would be a good fit with your team. I have versatile skills in economics, finance, statistics, mathematics and data analytics. </p>

    <p> Having completed my MA in Economics at The University of Rochester in Fall of 2014, I returned to Houston and began learning the computer skills that I would need to be successful in data science. During this time, I founded a tutoring business where I worked with students on advanced math topics and test prep. In Fall of 2016, I returned to The University of Texas, my undergraduate institution, to take classes in applied statistics, computer science and financial economics. Here, I developed further skills in R, Python, SQL, data cleaning, data analysis and data visualization. </p>

    <p> In August, I completed an internship at WorldQuant LLC as a member of the middle office team. My role consisted of 50% DevOps and 50% analysis. I worked closely with another intern to develop utilities and optimize WorldQuant's foreign equity hedging strategy. We created a reconciler to help explain anomalies between WorldQuant's foreign equity positions and the positions of its parent company, Millennium Management. We created one script to extract and clean spread data from WorldQuant's file system and another script to extract, clean and aggregate individual equity positions to determine daily exposure. Using data extracted with these utilities, we developed and tested a model to determine and minimize WorldQuant's risk due to foreign exposure. </p>

    <p> In September, I began working at VCC Management LLC as a contract employee. I am working with compliance and accounting to design, implement and automate the company-wide reconciliation process. This involves cleaning, aggregating and joining data from human-generated spreadsheets, legacy systems and Dept. of Education financial aid resources. </p>

    <p>After reviewing my resume, I hope that you will find me to be a strong candidate for a role at [company]. Please contact me at edkrueger@gmail.com or via phone at (713) 320-0700. I look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
